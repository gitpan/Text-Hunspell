Revision history for Perl extension Text::Hunspell.

2.04    2012/09/20 23:05:00    (cosimo)

        Fixed t/02_pod.t test due to newest Test::Pod and
        missing =encoding directive. Thanks to SHLOMIF for
        the patch.

2.03    2011/06/24 11:12:00    (cosimo)

        Fixed use of "qw()" as parenthesis in inc/Devel/CheckLib.pm
        because deprecated in perl 5.14. Thanks to H. Merijn Brand
        for reporting.

2.02    2010/10/24 13:02:00    (cosimo)

        Added an explicit warning if the unversioned libhunspell.so
        symlink or library is not found. Linking will almost certainly
        fail.

2.01    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Fixed build/test problems

2.00    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Now cosimo at cpan dot org is a co-maintainer for Text::Hunspell.

        Added a dirty hack to work around some underlying changes in
        libhunspell that made the XS code unable to initialize any
        Hunspell object.

1.xx    Author and maintainer was ELEONORA
