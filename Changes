Revision history for Perl extension Text::Hunspell.

2.02    2010/10/24 13:02:00    (cosimo)

        Added an explicit warning if the unversioned libhunspell.so
          symlink or library is not found. Linking will almost certainly
          fail.

2.01    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Fixed build/test problems

2.00    2010/09                (cosimo)

        Now cosimo at cpan dot org is a co-maintainer for Text::Hunspell.

        Added a dirty hack to work around some underlying changes in
          libhunspell that made the XS code unable to initialize any
          Hunspell object.

1.xx    Author and maintainer was ELEONORA
